/**
 * The primary transform file.
 * Inserts __coverDeclare(...) and __cover(id) to facilitate code coverage.
 * __coverDeclare raises the expected count of instances while
 * __cover raises the executed count.
 * To get results, it goes like this:
 * Uncovered: expected - executed
 * Covered: executed
 * Along with this, we get file coordinates that give us information about where the statement occured.
 * If you have any questions, please contact Joshua Tenner or Jairus Tanaka for information.
 * Also, please view the Contributing Guidelines before submitting changes.
 * Have fun!
